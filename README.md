# SYCL Info Tool

`syclinfo` is a lightweight command-line utility written in C++ using the SYCL programming model. It queries and displays detailed information about available SYCL devices on your system ‚Äî perfect for developers working with Intel GPUs and the oneAPI ecosystem.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Lists all available SYCL-compatible devices.
- Allows user to select a device by index and view detailed device info.
- Supports Level-Zero and OpenCL backends under Intel oneAPI.

---

## üîß Build Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit** (make sure it includes the DPC++ compiler).
- A supported SYCL device (e.g. Intel GPU, iGPU or CPU).

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/syclinfo.git syclinfo
cd syclinfo
```

### 3. Set Up oneAPI Environment
Before building, source the oneAPI environment script (adjust the path based on your installation):

Linux(terminal):
bash
```bash
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```
Windows (Command Prompt):
```shell
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat"
```

### 4. Compile
Use the Intel DPC++ compiler (icx) to build:

```bash
icx -fsycl syclinfo.cpp -o syclinfo.exe
```


### üß™ Usage
Run the executable:
```bash
./syclinfo.exe
```
### You will be prompted to select a device. Example output:
```bash
Available SYCL Devices:
[0] Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics | Intel(R) oneAPI Unified Runtime over Level-Zero
[1] Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics | Intel(R) OpenCL Graphics
